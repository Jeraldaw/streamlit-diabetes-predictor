        **Observations on Missing Data:**
        - Approximately 50% of the patients did not have their insulin levels measured. This initially raised a concern about potential data leakage, where doctors might only measure insulin levels in unhealthy-looking patients or after a preliminary diagnosis. If true, this could mean the model might not generalize well to data from doctors who measure insulin for every patient.
        - **Hypothesis Test:** To address this concern, it was checked whether the Insulin and SkinThickness features are correlated with the diagnostic outcome (healthy/diabetic).
        - **Conclusion:** The Insulin and SkinThickness measurements were found **not to be highly correlated with any given outcome**. As such, the concern of data leakage related to selective measurement could be ruled out.

        **Handling Erroneous Zero Values:**
        - Despite ruling out data leakage from selective measurement, the zero values in categories like Insulin and SkinThickness are still erroneous (e.g., a person cannot have 0 skin thickness). These values should not be included directly in the model.
        - **Imputation Strategy:** It is best practice to replace these erroneous zero values with some distribution of values, typically near the median measurement of that feature.
        - **Preventing Data Leakage during Imputation:** It is crucial to impute these values *after* the `train_test_split` function has been applied during the model training phase. This prevents another form of data leakage, ensuring that information from the testing data (e.g., its median value) is not used when calculating the imputation values for the training data. The original notebook's data preprocessing steps confirm that null values were indeed replaced with median values.

        Because all erroneous, missing, and null values were replaced with median values during the data preprocessing stage of the notebook, the data was then ready for model training and evaluation.

**Overall Conclusion:**
In summary, we were able to predict diabetes from medical records with an accuracy of approximately **82%**. This was achieved by utilizing tree-based classifiers, which effectively focus on the most important features such as blood glucose levels and body mass index. Interestingly, the model's performance remains robust even with fewer features; we observe only a **5% reduction in accuracy** when considering only blood glucose levels and body mass index, highlighting their dominant predictive power.
